# Sampling Method Final Project (Jakarta Workers Revenue in 2021)
A. Introduction & Background

The salary of informal workers in Jakarta is often a problem because they do not have the same rights and protection as formal workers. Some of the main issues are as follows:

1. Inadequate wages: Many informal workers in Jakarta do not receive adequate wages and are disproportionate to the number of hours they work. They are often forced to work more than one job to make ends meet.
2. Absence of social security: Informal workers in Jakarta rarely have access to social security services such as health insurance and pensions. This means that they have no guarantee of assistance if they develop health problems or are approaching retirement.
3. Lack of workers’ rights: Informal workers often do not have the same labor rights as formal workers, such as annual leave, rest periods, and the right to assembly and association.
4. Unsecured work stability: Informal workers in Jakarta often do not have work contracts and no guarantee of job stability. This means that they could be fired at any time for no apparent reason.
5. Discrimination: Many informal workers in Jakarta experience discrimination and stigma from society and employers because of their status as informal workers.

To solve the wage problem for informal workers in Jakarta, the government must ensure that informal workers have the same access as formal workers to social security services, workers’ rights and legal protection. The government must also work together with employers and the community to eliminate discrimination and stigma against informal workers.
Comparison of salary and level of education for informal workers in Jakarta is often lower than for formal workers. Informal workers in Jakarta include a large number of workers, such as daily workers, farm workers, construction workers and many more. They often work in situations that do not have the same legal protections as formal workers, and their salaries are often lower.

The level of education does not always have a significant effect on the wages of informal workers. Informal workers often work in positions that do not require a particular level of education, and their salary is often determined by the level of market demand for a particular type of work and is independent of their level of education.
However, although the level of education does not always affect the wages of informal workers, education is still important to help informal workers understand their rights and protections as a workforce, and help them find better and better jobs in the long term. Therefore, education is still considered an important factor for the welfare and quality of life of informal workers in Jakarta.

UMR (Regional Minimum Wage) and UMP (Provincial Minimum Wage) are minimum salary standards determined by the government every year for each region. UMR and UMP are the minimum amounts that must be received by workers to meet the needs of themselves and their families.
UMR DKI Jakarta is the minimum salary standard determined by the government every year for the Jakarta area. This UMR is intended for formal and informal workers who work in Jakarta.

UMP DKI Jakarta is the minimum salary standard determined by the government every year for the Jakarta area. This UMP is intended for formal workers who work in Jakarta.

These two standards provide a reference for companies and employers to provide a decent minimum wage for their workers. Therefore, UMR and UMP are very important for workers, especially for workers who have low wages and need financial support from their salaries.

Meanwhile, based on a release from the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta, the UMR and UMP of the Province of DKI Jakarta continue to increase from year to year. The increase in UMR and UMP in 2023 was recorded at IDR 4,901,798. This amount increased by 5.6% from the previous year (year-on-year/yoy) which amounted to IDR 4,641,854.

Based on this, the author will carry out a sampling design on the income level of information workers in DKI Jakarta in 2023 for further analysis by stakeholders regarding the resilience of this group of workers in facing potential economic crises in the future. The hope that can be achieved from this research is to obtain population parameters for income levels in the form of average (mean) and distribution (variance) which can later be used for public policy purposes.
A. Analysis
Based on the results of the sampling design above, it can be concluded that:
1. Prior knowledge is needed in the sampling design process to make it easier to provide value assumptions for the parameters in sampling
2. Based on the results of the sampling design, multistage sampling was used with the first stratification using education level, the second stratification related to districts/cities, cluster sampling at the sub-district level, and simple random sampling at the lowest level
3. Based on the calculation of the sampling design, at least 526 samples are needed to get a statistical picture regarding the level of income of informal workers in DKI Jakarta where the total sample is considered reasonable
4. The cost incurred to carry out this sampling is Rp. 105,600,000 consisting of a fixed cost of Rp. 5,000,000 and the sampling fee for the PSU and SSU levels is Rp. 100,000 per sample where this value is still relatively affordable for government agencies in survey needs. The cost per survey is still a “worst case” assumption where the cost can still be reduced by up to 70–80%
5. To carry out this sampling, telephone and online messenger methods were used to ask the survey participants the amount of income each month. So that the use of resources and the allocation of surveyors will be more flexible.

The advantages of the sampling design carried out are:
1. Clear sampling stratification so that inferences can also be made for each district/city in DKI Jakarta
2. Multi-stage sampling is relatively cheaper and more efficient than SRS because the target population is large and geographically dispersed
3. This method is quite flexible in using any sampling method
Weaknesses of the sampling design carried out are:
1. Compared to SRS, a larger sample size is required for multi-stage samples to obtain the same statistical inference
2. Selection of the best sampling method at each stage is subjective, so clear reasons are needed to avoid biased decision making
3. Can lead to non-representative samples because a large portion of the population may not be selected in the population collection, potentially leading to undercoverage bias and selection bias

B. Conclusion
1. To conduct a sampling of the income level of informal workers in DKI Jakarta in 2023, a sample of 526 people is required, stratified based on their education level and city of residence (Multi Stage Sampling).
2. The cost incurred for conducting this sampling is Rp. 105,600,000 and can still be optimized again
3. Sampling is done using the telephone method or online massager
4. The advantage of using this method is that it is cheaper and more efficient for geographically dispersed target populations
5. The drawback of this method is that it requires a large sample size, and there is a potential for bias due to an unrepresentative sample
